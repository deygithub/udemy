    This challenge is about using a collention (list) of integers and allowing the user
    to select options from a menu to perform operations on the list.

    Your program should display a menu options to the user as follows:

    P - Print Numbers 
    A - Add a Number 
    M - Display mean of the numbers
    S - Display the smallest number
    L - Display the largest number
    Q - Quit

    Enter you choice:

    The program should only accept valid choices from the user, both upper and lowercase selections should be allowed.
    If an illegal choice is made, you should display, "Unknown selection, please try again" and the menu options should be 
    diplayed again.


    If the use enters 'P' or 'p', you should display all the elements (ints) in the list.
    If the list is empty you should display "[] - the list is empty"
    If the list is not empty then all the list elemnts should be displayed inside square brackets separated bya space.
    For example, [1 2 3 4 5]


    If the user enters 'A' or 'a' then you should prompt the user for an integer to add to the list
    which you will add to the list and then display it was added.For example, if the user enters 5
    You should display, "5 added".
    Duplicate list entries are OK

    If the user enters 'M' ot 'm' you should calculate the mean or average of the elements in the list and display it.
    If the list is empty you should display. "Unable to calculate the mean - no data"

    If the user enters 'S' or 's' you should display calculate the smallest element in the list.
    For example, if the list contains[2 4 5 1], you should display. "The smallest number is 1"
    If the list is empty you should display "Unable to determine smallest number, list is empty"

    If the user enters 'L' or 'l' you should display the largest element in the list
    For example, if the list contains [2 4 5 1], you should display."The largest number is 5" 
    If the list is empty you should display. "Unable to determine the largest number - list is empty"

    If teh user enters 'Q' or 'q' then you should display "Goodbye" and the program should terminate.

    Before you begin. Write out the steps you need to take and decide in what order they should be done.
    Think about what loops you should use as well as what you will use for you selection logic.

    This exercise can be challenging! It may take a few attempts before you complete it -- that's OK!

    Finally, be sure to test you program as you go and the end .

    HINT : Use a vector!

    Additional functionality if you wish to extend this program

    -search for a number in the list and if found display the number of times it occurs in the list
    -cleaning out teh list (make it empty again) (Hint: the vector class has a .clear() method)
    -come up with you own ideas!

    Good Luck!!
